# airtable-api

![screenshot](screen_shot.png)

a small node.js application to test out pulling data from airtable.  app.js contains the express server that pulls the weekly shop hours from my airtable account.  Feel free to modify for your use.  to prevent overloading of the api, server caches data and updates every 10s max.
